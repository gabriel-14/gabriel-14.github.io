                    The Italian Game is one of the oldest openings in chess and has been around for centuries. This classical 1.e4 opening can lead to slower and positional games as well as open, tactical battles. Although very common among beginners, the Italian Game is
                    a part of the repertoire of players of every level.

                    The Sicilian Defense is the most popular response to White's 1.e4. Employed by masters and beginners alike, the Sicilian Defense is a reputable and positionally sound opening. Still, the Sicilian is a combative opening that tends to lead to dynamic and
                    sharp positions. One of the oldest registered openings, the Sicilian is full of theory and was used by most of the greatest players in history. World champions GMs Bobby Fischer, Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, Vladimir Kramnik,
                    and Magnus Carlsen are just a few of its adopters.

                    is still one of the cornerstones of every elite players' repertoire. It's also an excellent choice for beginners and intermediate players.

                    The Scotch Game is a centuries-old 1.e4 opening for White and one of the best alternatives to the Ruy Lopez. A good opening for beginners, the Scotch is also an excellent weapon for players of every strength level. One of its most prominent adopters was
                    GM Garry Kasparov. Other elite players like GMs Vladimir Kramnik, Levon Aronian, and Magnus Carlsen also have the Scotch as part of their arsenal.

                    The Caro-Kann Defense is known above all for its solidity. The defining move, 1...c6, is the fourth most popular reply to 1.e4 and nearly twice as common as the number five move. It prepares for 2...d5 without blocking in the light-squared bishop, which
                    is considered the main drawback of its cousin the French Defense (1.e4 e6). A standby for positional players at almost every level, the Caro-Kann was a particular favorite of world champion GM Anatoly Karpov.
